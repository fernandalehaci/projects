The main script takes the addresses input into a [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10_WYNU6WQ0s0KGgxvEbgcQ-RIb8ggfU4rxK51XKfoNI/edit?gid=0#gid=0) , and writes the associated Placekey and Placekey Confidence in columns E and F. 
See more details on the concept of"Placekeying" and the API here: https://docs.placekey.io/documentation 
Script can currently only be run using a specific gserviceaccount (credentials.json files was added to .gitignore), however this can be used as a reference by others.
